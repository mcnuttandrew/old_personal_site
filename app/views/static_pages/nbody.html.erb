		<p>This is a low count n-body simulator I built in December 2013. It is built in the Processing langauge and supported here by the Processing.js enviroment. In this visualization the particles operate in a roughly gravitational way, in that they follow 1/r interaction, and there is an enforced maximum speed.</p>
			
			<p>The simulation uses a traditional leap-frog integration scheme for computing the values. The size of the rings are approximately proportionate to the "mass" of the particle. The black lines indicates interaction between particles, but have a minimum interaction in order to appear.</p>
